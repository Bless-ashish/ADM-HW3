Heritage is a global phenomenon with diverse economic, social, and political roles. It encompasses the surviving tangible and intangible traces of the past, but also the processes and practices that frame heritage in the present and produce particular kinds of futures.The aim of this degree programme is to provide a critically informed interdisciplinary education in heritage. You may choose to specialise to take the broad programme without specialisation, or opt to specialise in a Cultural Heritage Studies pathway.
