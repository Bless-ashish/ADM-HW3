Design and Urban Ecologies
The New School
Parsons School of Design
The 60-credit Master of Science in Design and Urban Ecologies program radically reframes the study of cities and urban design methodologies. By combining research, fieldwork, and participatory action, students gain a broad understanding of the complex forces that influence urban growth and development. In accordance with The New Schoolâ€™s historic commitment to social justice and design, students develop and implement innovative strategic projects that bring about real, transformative urban change.
