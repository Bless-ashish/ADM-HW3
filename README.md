# Homework 3 (Group 20) - Master's Degrees from all over!

This is the repository Maintained by Group 20 for the Homework 3 of ADM. The objective was to webscrape informations about nearly 6000 MSCs and build a search engine to return the top **k** suggested MSCs given a specific query. Several similarity measures were implemented and compared. An interactive map displaying the suggested courses is included.
